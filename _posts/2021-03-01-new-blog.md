I migrated my blog to Azure!

I know it's still a bit empty here, i'll be migrating some of my old posts soon.

The cool thing (i think) is that this site is being hosted on azure as a static website, deployed via Azure pipelines from Github **#eatyourowndogfood**. 

I'll be posting about the setup soon, just wanted to leave a note about the change here :)
