I felt like reviving the some what dormant place of the interwebs today.

I moved my blog from Azure Storage to a GitHub pages using Jekyll!
Major thanks to [xplor4r](https://github.com/sujaykundu777) for providing the [devlopr-jekyll](https://github.com/sujaykundu777/devlopr-jekyll) Jekyll template (which i probably already broken somehow with my practically non-existant Jekyll skills).
The plan is to be a bit more active on the blog, by hopefully reducing the barrier for my to start typing.

There are still some changes i want to make to the site but let's see where this goes :)
